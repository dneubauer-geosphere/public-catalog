  "Title": "Temperature Forecast, Cooling/Heating Degree Days for Cities in Austria",
  "Description": "This dataset provides high-resolution (100 m) air temperature forecasts and derived heating and cooling degree days for Vienna. The data shown in the explorer are example results from a heatwave in June/July 2019.\n\nAir temperature is simulated hourly on a 100 m grid using urban-specific information, including building density, land cover, vegetation, and anthropogenic heat emissions. This allows identification of neighbourhood-scale heat hotspots and temperature variations that cannot be captured by standard regional weather models.\n\n**Displayed variables**\n\n* 2 m Air Temperature (°C)\nHourly air temperature at pedestrian level, resolved at 100 m.\n* Cooling Degree Days (CDD)\n    Indicator of cooling demand. High values highlight areas and times where air conditioning or other cooling measures may be needed.\n* Heating Degree Days (HDD)\n    Indicator of heating demand. During this heatwave, HDD values are zero, as heating is not required.\n\nPurpose and use\n* Assessment of urban heat stress and identification of vulnerable neighborhoods\n* Energy planning, including cooling demand for buildings",
